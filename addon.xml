[B][COLOR red]Update - v6.4.5 - Jan. 11, 2022[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] tvdb.api.key will not longer be sync'd from the My Accounts addon.  This caused the settings cleaner in Venom to always remove it since it's no longer required.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue where randomly the pre-resolved next url to play would not clear.  Sometimes stopping playback would cause the next episode to play when this url did not clear.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Pre-resolving randomly failed in the background causing the resolving dialog to be shown between episodes when in continual playback mode.  This has now been fixed and the pre-resolved url should be readily available to skip resolving during continual playback.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] The IMDb movie meta check has been expanded to now also cover shows.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] The download progress notification will now indicate the percentage downloaded as a header so it becomes fixed and will no longer autoscroll with the title.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting to prioritize HEVC sources to top of the Source Select list.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] RD has fixed the [B]"instantAvailability"[/B] endpoint bug when cache checking pack files.  The setting to remove show packs from RD source results has been removed and is no longer needed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] RD has removed the 100 hashes limitation per request in the [B]"instantAvailability"[/B] endpoint.  The code has been adjusted for a single request of all hashes.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed premiered dates shown in utc for [B]"Trakt-Recent Episodes, "Trakt-Upcoming Episodes"[/B] and [B]"Trakt-Season Premiered"[/B]. The highlight label was correct.[/I]
